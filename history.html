									Manchester United's home fixtures began within a capacity of 50,000 prior to planning a 
									new stadium with doubled capacity near Trafford Park Industrial State. Architect, 
									Archibald Leitch designed the new stadium which officially opened in 1910. Unfortunately, 
									Manchester United suffered a 4-3 defeat to Liverpool in the first game at this new stadium. 
									In addition, Old Trafford's capacity was reduced from 100,000 to 80,000 as a way for the 
									club to save money. An FA Cup semi-final between Wolves & Grimbsy Town saw Old Trafford 
									achieve its highest attendance record with 76,962. During WW2, Old Trafford suffered 
									significant damage from German air raids and unable to host any matches until being 
									repaired. The repairs were affected due to delays in limited post-war resources and had 
									been completed after 8 long years. Upon completion in 1949, Manchester United returned to 
									Old Trafford with improvements and expansions made to restoring the United Road (North) 
									Stand. Thereafter, Old Trafford became a revenue in the World Cup during 1966 and hosted 
									3 group stage matches. This time period saw Old Trafford's capacity to vary around 60,000. 
									Although, the stadium demonstrated improvements between the 1970s and 1980s with new, 
									improved covers, more seating arrangements and improved executive facilities with the 
									exception of hooliganism requiring fences to separate stands from the pitch. In relation, 
									1990 saw plans in place to convert Old Trafford into an all-seater meaning Stretford End 
									terraces and lower tier seats would be destroyed prior to having new replacements. In 
									2006, newly built stands in the North Stands upper-tier corners saw Old Trafford reach 
									its current maximum capacity. Also, the North Stand had been renamed as “Sir Alex 
									Ferguson Stand” honoring Manchester United's long-time manager in 2011.

									Manchester United sponsored by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company, were 
									a limited company selling shares to their supporters in 1982. Following this, 
									ownership of the club had been passed onto 4 businessmen who spent £500 to prevent 
									Manchester United from becoming bankrupt. Unfortunately, this was inevitable as 
									Manchester United became bankrupt following the death of John Henry Davies in 1927. 
									During December 1931, a £2000 investment was made by James W. Gibson saving the club 
									from bankruptcy. In addition, Gibson's son, Alan contributed to this club following 
									promotion onto the Manchester United Board in 1948. 3 years later, Alan passed away 
									leading to the Glazer family keeping possession of Manchester United courtesy of 
									Gibson's wife Lillian. Furthermore, Harold Hardman, a former Manchester United player 
									was appointed Chairman while Louis Edwards gained promotion to the Board following the 
									Munich Disaster. Upon her death in January 1971, Lillian's shares were passed onto Alan 
									Gibson who during 1978, sold a percentage of these shares to Martin Edwards. Similarly, 
									Edwards became Chairman upon the death of his father in 1980. In 1984, media proprietor 
									Robert Maxwell looked to purchase ownership of Manchester United. However, Maxwell failed 
									to meet Edwards' purchase price. In relation, Edwards tried selling the club to Micheal 
									Knighton for £20 million. Even though this deal collapsed, Knighton became a Board Of 
									Directors in 1989. At one time in 1971, the club raised £6.7 million in their stock market 
									prior to involvement in a takeover bid during 1998 from Sky UK. In April 1999, a £623 
									million offer for a takeover was accepted by the Board prior to being blocked by the 
									Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Several years later, John Magnier, J.P. McManus and Sir 
									Alex Ferguson became club shareholders and a struggle occurred among these 3 individuals. 
									Both Magnier and McManus aimed to remove Ferguson from his role as Manchester United manager. 
									In May 2005, Malcom Glazer bought 28.7% of the stake belonging to both Magnier and McManus 
									ahead of gaining an interest courtesy of his investment vehicle Red Football Ltd during a 
									takeover valued at about £800 million. Finalisation of this purchase led to Manchester United 
									being removed from the stock market exchange. As a result, the club confirmed a £660 million 
									debt refinancing package. Thus, leading towards a 30% decrease in yearly interest payments to 
									£62 million per year during July 2006. By January 2010, Manchester United were £716.5 million 
									in debt and refinanced using a bond issue value at £504 million allowing £509 million to be 
									paid off.

									A 1958 European Cup tie featured Manchester United travelling to Yugoslavia in a fixture 
									against Red Star Belgrade. The Manchester United squad along with other individuals boarded 
									a flight returning to the UK on 6th February 1958. The flight landed in Munich to refuel. 
									Unfortunately, the aeroplane encountered engine problems resulting in aborting 2 departures. 
									But, a third departure was the aeroplane's chance to take off. However, the runway was covered 
									with snow resulting in the aeroplane colliding into a fence then a house. As a result, the 
									following passengers lost their lives: Roger Bryne, Eddie Colman, David Pegg, Mark Jones,
									Tommy Taylor, Duncan Edwards, Geoff Bent, Liam “Billy” Whelan, Walter Crickmaker (Club Secretary),
									Tom Curry (Trainer), Bert Whalley (Coach), Willie Santinoff, Bela Miklos (Travel Agent) &amp; 
									Tom Cable.
								</p>
								
								<br>

								<p>
									In addition, the following 8 journalists also lost their lives: Alf Clarke, Tom Jackson, Don Davies,
									George Fellows, Archie Ledbrook, Eric Thompson, Henry Rose &amp; Frank Swift. Although he survived, 
									captain Kenneth Rayment passed away a few weeks after the incident due to serious injuries.
