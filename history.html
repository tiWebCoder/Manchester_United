									Manchester United's home fixtures began within a capacity of 50,000 prior 
									to planning a new stadium with doubled capacity near Trafford Park Industrial
									State. Architect, Archibald Leitch designed the new stadium which officially 
									opened in 1910. Unfortunately, Manchester United suffered a 4-3 defeat to 
									Liverpool in the first game at this new stadium. In addition, Old Trafford's 
									capacity was reduced from 100,000 to 80,000 as a way for the club to save 
									money. An FA Cup semi-final between Wolves & Grimbsy Town saw Old Trafford 
									achieve its highest attendance record with 76,962. During WW2, Old Trafford 
									suffered significant damage from German air raids and unable to host any 
									matches until being repaired. The repairs were affected due to delays in 
									limited post-war resources and had been completed after 8 long years. Upon 
									completion in 1949, Manchester United returned to Old Trafford with 
									improvements and expansions made to restoring the United Road (North) Stand. 
									Thereafter, Old Trafford became a revenue in the World Cup during 1966 and 
									hosted 3 group stage matches. This time period saw Old Trafford's capacity to 
									vary around 60,000. Although, the stadium demonstrated improvements between 
									the 1970s and 1980s with new, improved covers, more seating arrangements and 
									improved executive facilities with the exception of hooliganism requiring 
									fences to separate stands from the pitch. In relation, 1990 saw plans in place 
									to convert Old Trafford into an all-seater meaning Stretford End terraces and 
									lower tier seats would be destroyed prior to having new replacements. In 2006, 
									newly built stands in the North Stands upper-tier corners saw Old Trafford 
									reach its current maximum capacity. Also, the North Stand had been renamed as 
									“Sir Alex Ferguson Stand” honoring Manchester United's long-time manager in 2011.

								<p>
									Manchester United sponsored by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway 
									Company, were a limited company selling shares to their supporters in 
									1982. Following this, ownership of the club had been passed onto 4 
									businessmen who spent £500 to prevent Manchester United from becoming 
									bankrupt. Unfortunately, this was inevitable as Manchester United became 
									bankrupt following the death of John Henry Davies in 1927. During December
									1931, a £2000 investment was made by James W. Gibson saving the club from 
									bankruptcy. In addition, Gibson's son, Alan contributed to this club 
									following promotion onto the Manchester United Board in 1948. 3 years 
									later, Alan passed away leading to the Glazer family keeping possession 
									of Manchester United courtesy of Gibson's wife Lillian. Furthermore, 
									Harold Hardman, a former Manchester United player was appointed Chairman 
									while Louis Edwards gained promotion to the Board following the Munich 
									Disaster. Upon her death in January 1971, Lillian's shares were passed 
									onto Alan Gibson who during 1978, sold a percentage of these shares to 
									Martin Edwards. Similarly, Edwards became Chairman upon the death of his 
									father in 1980. In 1984, media proprietor Robert Maxwell looked to 
									purchase ownership of Manchester United. However, Maxwell failed to meet 
									Edwards' purchase price. In relation, Edwards tried selling the club to 
									Micheal Knighton for £20 million. Even though this deal collapsed, Knighton
									became a Board Of Directors in 1989. At one time in 1971, the club raised 
									£6.7 million in their stock market prior to involvement in a takeover bid 
									during 1998 from Sky UK. In April 1999, a £623 million offer for a takeover
									was accepted by the Board prior to being blocked by the Monopolies and 
									Mergers Commission. Several years later, John Magnier, J.P. McManus and 
									Sir Alex Ferguson became club shareholders and a struggle occurred among 
									these 3 individuals. Both Magnier and McManus aimed to remove Ferguson 
									from his role as Manchester United manager. In May 2005, Malcom Glazer 
									bought 28.7% of the stake belonging to both Magnier and McManus ahead of 
									gaining an interest courtesy of his investment vehicle Red Football Ltd 
									during a takeover valued at about £800 million. Finalisation of this 
									purchase led to Manchester United being removed from the stock market 
									exchange. As a result, the club confirmed a £660 million debt refinancing 
									package. Thus, leading towards a 30% decrease in yearly interest payments 
									to £62 million per year during July 2006. By January 2010, Manchester 
									United were £716.5 million in debt and refinanced using a bond issue value 
									at £504 million allowing £509 million to be paid off.

								<p>
									A 1958 European Cup tie featured Manchester United travelling to Yugoslavia
									in a fixture against Red Star Belgrade. The Manchester United squad along 
									with other individuals boarded a flight returning to the UK on 6th February 
									1958. The flight landed in Munich to refuel. Unfortunately, the aeroplane 
									encountered engine problems resulting in aborting 2 departures. But, a 
									third departure was the aeroplane's chance to take off. However, the 
									runway was covered with snow resulting in the aeroplane colliding into a 
									fence then a house. As a result, the following passengers lost their 
									lives: Roger Bryne, Eddie Colman, David Pegg, Mark Jones, Tommy Taylor, 
									Duncan Edwards, Geoff Bent, Liam “Billy” Whelan, Walter Crickmaker (Club 
									Secretary), Tom Curry (Trainer), Bert Whalley (Coach), Willie Santinoff, 
									Bela Miklos (Travel Agent) &amp; Tom Cable.
								</p>

								<br>

								<p>
									Amongst all these passengers, the following 8 journalists lost their lives:
									Alf Clarke, Tom Jackson, Don Davies, George Fellows, Archie Ledbrook, Eric 
									Thompson, Henry Rose &amp; Frank Swift. Although he survived, captain 
									Kenneth Rayment passed away a few weeks after the incident due to serious 
									injuries.
